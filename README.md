# Parametric-Art-Nouveau
Computational Art: Project 3 (Parametric Generated Art Nouveau)

In this project, my partner, Victoria Rund (who I worked on my first project with), and I used multiple parametric 
equations to recreate a sample of art nouveau.

After exploring parametric equations in the Celtic Knot lab, Victoria and I made some curves from some sine equations
and made some circular and other unique shapes. Another element of the scene are the flowers in the back which 
are generated randomly much like in the Generative Art lab.

Within this repository, you will find a demo video of the final product attached. Enjoy!
